There's no place like a safe cloud

## Description
Glass is a framework for authenticated and end-to-end-encrypted multi-application communication.

## Inspiring existing protocols
* XMPP
* SOCKS5
* HTTP Cloud API

## Language
Currently being implemented in Go.

## Client API
The Client API allows any application to use the Glass Framework with the smallest adaptation overhead.

Please have a look at the wiki entry [Go API](https://github.com/acondolu/glassbox/wiki/Go-API) for more information and examples.

## Root Server
This is the main app installed in the actual glass box. It is the only application that can access and handle the user's private key.
